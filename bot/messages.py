Hello {} 🤩

I see you need some help on how to use the TeleQuest bot in: {}

You can ask a question in two ways:

1️⃣ **Type `/q` followed by your question.** 
    For example: "`/q` When is the assignment deadline?"

2️⃣ **Reply to a question with `/q`.**

    "no_tagged_question": """
It seems you have called /q without tagging a question.
Please tag a question when you use this command, or add a question to your message.

Hello, {} 👋
I'm TeleQuest, your group chat assistant. I am here to provide quick responses to previously asked questions or conversations in your group chat 🔍

**To start:** 
🤖 Add me to one of your groups as an admin. You need to be the group owner to do this.
    • Tap "TeleQuest" on the top of your screen.
    • Tap "Add to Group or Channel"
    • Select your group.
    • Make sure "Admin Rights" is enabled.

Now you are ready to get started! 🎉

📝 Use `/q` followed by your question.
