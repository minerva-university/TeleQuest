Hello {} 🤩

I see you need some help on how to use the TeleQuest bot in: {}

You can ask a question in two ways:

1️⃣ **Type `/q` followed by your question.** 
    For example: "`/q` When is the assignment deadline?"

2️⃣ **Reply to a question with `/q`.**

Please tag a question when you use this command, or add a question to your message.
